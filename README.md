Compression, text and binary compression

- You’ll learn how to compress data using the [Huffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) coding algorithm, the [LZW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch) algorithm and others.
- You’ll demonstrate what you learned by writing a command-line utility to compress/ decompress files.
